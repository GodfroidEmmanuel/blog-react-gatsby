JSX
React uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. It is not necessary to use it, however, following are some pros that come with it.

* It is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.

* It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.

* It makes it easier and faster to write templates, if you are familiar with HTML.

#### Using JSX
JSX looks like a regular HTML in most cases. We already used it in the Environment Setup chapter. Look at the code from App.jsx where we are returning div.

```App.jsx
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            Hello World!!!
         </div>
      );
   }
}
export default App;
```
Even though it's similar to HTML, there are a couple of things we need to keep in mind when working with JSX.
